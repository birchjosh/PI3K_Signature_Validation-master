<H3>I.  Analysis</H3>
<UL>
<LI>I ran a signature analysis using a training set of <SPAN STYLE=background-color:yellow>Pi3K_signature_gfp.txt</SPAN> and <SPAN STYLE=background-color:yellow>Pi3K_signature_tpm.txt</SPAN>.  I generated predictions on <SPAN STYLE=background-color:yellow>icbp_Rsubread_tpmlog.txt</SPAN>.
<LI>I used the <SPAN STYLE=background-color:yellow>BinReg 2</SPAN> algorithm with <SPAN STYLE=background-color:yellow>400 genes</SPAN> and <SPAN STYLE=background-color:yellow>1 metagene</SPAN>.
<LI>I applied <SPAN STYLE=background-color:yellow>DWD</SPAN> normalization.
<LI>For the statistical (Markov chain Monte Carlo) simulation, I discarded 1,000 samples for the burn-in and then collected 5,000 samples for the model.

<B>Figure 1: Signature Heatmap. </B>In this heatmap, each row represents a gene in the signature. The first 8 columns are the samples from the <EM>train0</EM> data set, and the remaining 9 columns are the samples from the <EM>train1</EM> data set. Warm colors indicate high expression of the gene, and cool colors indicate low expression.

<B>Figure 2: Predictions. </B>This scatter plot shows the predictions from the signature for each sample. On the Y-axis, high probabilities indicate that the gene expression profile of the sample better resembles the train 1 class, while low probabilities indicate a closer resemblance to train 0.  The blue and red circles are the predictions (from leave-one-out cross-validation) on the train 0 and train 1 samples, respectively. The black squares are the predictions on the test samples. The error bars show the 95% credible interval. The X-axis, the Metagene Score, is the magnitude of the sample on the first principal component. This is used to help separate the samples across the plot.<P>The raw values from this plot are available as a tab-delimited text file: <A HREF=probabilities.txt>probabilities.txt</A>.
